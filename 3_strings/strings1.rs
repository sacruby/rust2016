// Make me compile without changing the function signature! Scroll down for hints :)

fn current_favorite_color() -> String {
    "blue"
}





























// The `current_favorite_color` function is currently returning a string slice with the `'static`
// lifetime. We know this because the data of the string lives in our code itself -- it doesn't
// come from a file or user input or another program -- so it will live as long as our program
// lives. But it is still a string slice. There's one way to create a `String` by converting a
// string slice covered in the Strings chapter of the book, and another way that uses the `From`
// trait.
