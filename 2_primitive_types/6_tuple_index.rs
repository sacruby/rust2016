// Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`.
// You can put this right into the `println!` where the ??? is.
// Scroll down for hints!

fn main() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
    println!("The second number is {}", ???);
}































// While you could use a destructuring `let` for the tuple here, try 
// indexing into it instead, as explained here:
// http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/primitive-types.html#tuple-indexing
// Now you have another tool in your toolbox!
