// There's a shorthand to initialize Arrays with a certain size that does not 
// require you to type in 100 items (but you certainly can if you want!)
// Check out the Primitive Types -> Arrays section of the book:
// http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/primitive-types.html#arrays
// Bonus: what are some other things you could have that would return true
// for `a.len() >= 100`?
